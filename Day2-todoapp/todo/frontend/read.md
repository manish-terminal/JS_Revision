why to use axios over fetch?
when sending data using fetch u need to stringify it and when receiving data using fetch u need to json it.
fetch is handling the error by catch block
fetch is not able to handle network error

req.params will give (/register/:123) it will give {
'id':'123'
} colon k baad vala

? ke baad vala comes under req.query
